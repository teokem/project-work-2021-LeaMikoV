Thank you for the valuable input from the peer review.

I made the following changes in the jupyter notebook (as requested by the peer reviewers):

1) I added the abstract from the readme to the notebook.
2) In cell 10, I changed the standard format to save the data to a .csv file. In case the user prefers an excel file, the corresponding code can be uncommented.
3) In the markdown cell before code cell 17 I added that the scikit-learn is loaded.

As mentioned, I prefer to load the data from the files and not from a link in order to be sure that the notebook can be run even if the links won't exist any longer. 
I also do not have a better idea how to avoid cells with a lot of code to produce interactive plots.
