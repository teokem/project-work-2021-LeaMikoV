Thank you for the valuable input from the peer review.

I made the following changes in the jupyter notebook:
1) I added the abstract from the readme to the notebook.
2) In cell 10, I changed the standard format to save the data to a .csv file. In case the user prefers an excel file, the corresponding code can be uncommented.
3) In the markdown cell before code cell 17 I added that the scikit-learn will be loaded.
