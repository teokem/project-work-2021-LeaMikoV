# Climate Observations: Data Analysis and Visualization

## Abstract


## How to run the notebook:
There exist two possibilities to run this notebook:
1) By clicking on the binder link above. Next, click on 'ProjectLea.ipynb' and run all cells by choosing . Some plots have widgets such that the user can choose parameters.
2) Download this github repository and unzip. Then install and activate the ProjectLea environment described by the file environment.yml. Then the notebook ProjectLea.ipynb can be run using jupyter notebook.

## Required packages:

  - python=3.9.2: Everything is written in Python
  - notebook=6.3.0: The project is written in a jupyter notebook
  - matplotlib=3.4.1: Needed for the figures
  - bokeh=2.3.1: Needed to create interactive figures
  - ipywidgets=7.6.3: Needed to create widgets for figures
  - numpy=1.20.2: Needed to do numerical/scientific calculations (numpy faster than scipy, thus this choice)
  - pandas=1.2.3: Needed to handle data
  - pip=21.0.1: In case the user wants to install more packages
  - geopandas=0.9.0: Needed to create map plot
  - scikit-learn=0.24.1: Needed to do some statistis
